# 3. BDSS trees
# -------------

# This tutorial walks you through setting up a configuration file to simulate phylogenetic trees with a birth-death with superspreading (BDSS) model.

# In BDSS settings there are two different states/populations: a (normal) infectious state (I) and superspreader state (S).
# Their behaviour is parameterized by five values:
# - R_0: reproduction number;
# - T_I: infectious period;
# - r_SS: superspreading ratio;
# - f_SS: superspreaders proportion;
# - s: sampling_proportion.

# In this example, we generate a dataset with 100 training samples, 10 validation samples, and 10 test samples. For each sample:
# - The reproduction number is drawn from a lognormal distribution (mean=1, sigma=0.2);
# - The sampling proportion is fixed to 0.25;
# - The infectious period is fixed to 2.5;
# - The superspreading ratio is randomly drawn at uniform between 2 and 10;
# - The superspreaders proportion is randomly drawn at uniform between 0.1 and 0.3;

# For each simulation, a target number of leaves between 50 and 250 is drawn uniformly at random, and the simulation ends when the target number of leaves is reached.

# Context
# -------

# In this example, we want to draw the initial state of the simulation from a discrete distribution, where the probability of being in the superspreader state is defined by the superspreaders proportion (f_SS). This can be done using the choice distribution, which allows you to specify a list of possible values and their corresponding probabilities. Importantly, we define the p argument of the choice distribution as a string. This string will be evaluated in the context of the current sample, allowing us to use the value of f_SS directly.

# Parameterization-specific parameters

# The BDSS model uses four SkylineParameters:
# - reproduction_number;
# - infectious_period;
# - superspreading_ratio;
# - superspreaders_proportion;
# - sampling_proportion.

# Tree simulation parameters

# In this example, we want the set the initial state of the simulation based on the value of a string context variable (init_state). This is done by including init_state inside curly braces. Phylogenie will automatically replace this with the value of the init_state variable at runtime.
