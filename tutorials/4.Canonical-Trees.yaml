# 4. Canonical trees
# ------------------

# This tutorial walks you through setting up a configuration file to simulate phylogenetic trees with a generic multi-type birth-death (MTBD) model using a canonical parameterization.

# The canonical parameterization of an MTBD model with m states/populations is characterized by the following parameters:
# - An m-dimensional vector of birth rates;
# - An m-dimensional vector of death rates;
# - An m-dimensional vector of sampling rates;
# - An mx(m-1)-dimensional matrix of migration (transition) rates;
# - An mx(m-1)-dimensional matrix of transmission rates among states.

# In this example, we will generate a dataset consisting of 100 training samples using an MTBD model with m=3 states: A, B, and C.

# The simulated scenario models an epidemic with two distinct phases, separated by a time split at t=1:
# - Phase 1 (before t=1):
#   Migration occurs between the three states.
#   Transmissions occur within each state.
#   No sampling is performed.
# - Phase 2 (after t=1):
#   Populations become isolated (no further migration and transmission between states).
#   Sampling begins within each state.

# For each sample in the dataset:
# - Migration rates:
#   In phase 1, migration rates are randomly drawn from a uniform distribution between 0.1 and 0.3.
#   In phase 2, they are set to zero, to reflect isolation.
# - Birth rates among states:
#   In phase 1, birth rates among states are drawn from a lognormal distribution (mean=0.7, sigma=0.3).
#   In phase 2, they are set to zero, to reflect isolation.
# - Birth rates within states:
#   In phase 1, birth rates within states are drawn from a lognormal distribution (mean=1, sigma=0.3).
#   In phase 2, they are drawn from a lognormal distribution (mean=0.5, sigma=0.3).
# - Sampling rates:
#   In phase 1, the sampling rates are fixed at zero.
#   In phase 2, they are drawn from a uniform distribution between 0.1 and 0.4.
# - Death rates:
#   Assumed to be constant over time and across states.
#   Death rates are drawn from a uniform distribution between 0.1 and 0.5.

# This setup captures the dynamics of an epidemic that initially spreads freely among interconnected states and then transitions to isolated states with active sampling.

# For each simulation, a target number of leaves between 50 and 250 is drawn uniformly at random, and the simulation ends when the target number of leaves is reached.

  # The canonical parameterization uses three SkylineVectors:
  # - sampling_rates (equal to 0 by default);
  # - birth_rates (equal to 0 by default);
  # - death_rates (equal to 0 by default);
  # and two SkylineMatrices, that can be provided when the model involves more than one state:
  # - birth_rates_among_states (None by default);
  # - migration_rates (None by default).
  # It also requires you to specify the states involved in the simulation, as a list of strings, and whether the model involves removal after sampling or not (by default False). Here, we set remove_after_sampling to True, which is usually the case for epidemiological simulations.

  # In Phylogenie, a SkylineVector can be defined in one of the following ways:
  # 1) A (unique) scalar value, meaning the parameter stays constant across states and time;
  # 2) As a list of SkylineParameters, where each element represent the skyline value of the vector for a specific state;
  # 3) As a pair of attributes:
  #   - value: a list of values the vector will take over time. Each value can be a scalar (if the vector is constant across states) or a list of scalars (if the vector varies across states);
  #   - change_times: a list of times (starting from t=0) when the parameter changes to the next value.
  # In this last case, the value list must have exactly one more element than change_times.

  # A SkylineMatrix can be defined in one of the following ways:
  # 1) A (unique) scalar value, meaning the parameter stays constant across state pairs and time;
  # 2) As a list of SkylineVectors, where each element represent the skyline value of the matrix for a specific state;
  # 3) As a pair of attributes:
  #   - value: a list of values the matrix will take over time. Each value can be a scalar (if the matrix is constant across state pairs) or a nested (2D) list of scalars;
  #   - change_times: a list of times (starting from t=0) when the parameter changes to the next value.
  # In this last case, the value list must have exactly one more element than change_times.
