# 5. Epidemiological trees
# ------------------------

# This tutorial walks you through setting up a configuration file to simulate phylogenetic trees with a generic multi-type birth-death (MTBD) model using the epidemiological parameterization.

# The canonical parameterization of an MTBD model with m states/populations is characterized by the following parameters:
# - An m-dimensional vector of reproduction numbers;
# - An m-dimensional vector of become uninfectious rates;
# - An m-dimensional vector of sampling proportions.
# - An mx(m-1)-dimensional matrix of migration (transition) rates;
# - An mx(m-1)-dimensional matrix of reproduction numbers among states;

# In this example, we will use the generic epidemiological parameterization to model a birth-death with exposed-infectious (BDEI) process, reproducing the dataset of the 2.BDEI-Trees.yaml example.

# Parameterization-specific parameters

# The epidemiological parameterization uses three SkylineVectors:
# - sampling_proportions;
# - reproduction_numbers; (equal to 0 by default);
# - become_uninfectious_rates; (equal to 0 by default);
# and two SkylineMatrices, that can be provided when the model involves more than one state:
# - migration_rates (None by default).
# - reproduction_numbers_among_states (None by default);
# It also needs you to specify the states involved in the simulation, as a list of strings, and assumes removal after sampling.
