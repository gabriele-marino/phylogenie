# 6. Fossilize-birth-death (FBD) trees
# ------------------------------------

# This tutorial walks you through setting up a configuration file to simulate phylogenetic trees with a generic multi-type birth-death (MTBD) model using the fossilized birth-death (FBD) parameterization.

# The FBD parameterization of an MTBD model with m states/populations is characterized by the following parameters:
# - An m-dimensional vector of diversification rates;
# - An m-dimensional vector of turnover rates;
# - An m-dimensional vector of sampling proportions.
# - An mx(m-1)-dimensional matrix of migration (transition) rates;
# - An mx(m-1)-dimensional matrix of diversification rates among states;

# In this example, we will generate a dataset consisting of 100 training samples using an MTBD model with m=2 states: A and B. We draw the two diversification rates from a uniform distribution between 0.1 and 0.2, the two turnover rates from a uniform distribution between 0.3 and 0.5, and the (ancestor) sampling proportion (the same for both states) from a uniform distribution between 0.3 and 0.5. The migration rates from A to B and from B to A are set to 0.06 and 0.04, respectively. We also set full sampling at the present time.

# For each simulation, a target number of tips between 50 and 250 is drawn at random, and the simulation ends when the target number of tips is reached.

# Parameterization-specific parameters
# ------------------------------------

# The FBD parameterization uses three SkylineVectors:
# - sampling_proportions;
# - diversification (equal to 0 by default);
# - turnover; (equal to 0 by default);
# and two SkylineMatrices, that can be provided when the model involves more than one state:
# - diversification_between_states (None by default);
# - migration_rates (None by default).
# It also needs you to specify the states involved in the simulation, as a list of strings, and assumes sampling without removal (ancestor sampling).
